The Melody Improvisation Unit is a product that is inspired by a musician’s ability to improvise
over a set of chords. It attempts to simulate a musician’s musical intuitions when creating a line
of melody. MIU is a project that affords melody extemporization through the application of Fast
Fourier Transforms (FFTs), digital signal processing (DSP) theories, and melody generation
algorithms.
